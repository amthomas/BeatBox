This project teaches me more about GUI. However, it throws an exception... trying to figure that out now.

Fixed the exception--it works perfectly now. This is an example from the book.
As logical as its code is, I'm not sure if I'm ready to code something like this yet.
I'll try to make my own version using this as a template.
